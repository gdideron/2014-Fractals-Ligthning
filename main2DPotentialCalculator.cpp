// Create a NxN array that represents the grid

// Fill the array with 0s but for points associated with
// the bottom line of the grid (ground) that are filled with 1s

// Go through the array, take the potential of teh four surrouding
// points and average them.
// Change value of point to that average

//iterate the process an arbitrary number of times


//comments:
/*
 -break tasks down into functions to call from the main file
 
 -start with a finite number of iterations before moving on to
 recognising convergence
 
 -later allow the size of array dimensions to be flexible to 
 allow for further investigation
